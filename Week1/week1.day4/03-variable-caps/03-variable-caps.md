## Day 4 Exercise 3 - Variable Caps

* Write a function that takes a word as its argument

* If the word is 3 letters or shorter, return the original input. If the word is 4 letters or longer, return the word in ALLCAPS.

* So 'the' would stay 'the' but 'homework' would become 'HOMEWORK'

* Now write a function that takes a sentence in its argument and returns a string where the first function is applied to every word.

* Hint: str.split

* For example:

* * Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country

* * Now is the TIME for all GOOD men to COME to the aid of THEIR COUNTRY

* Now prompt the user for an input and print the processed string.
