## Day 4 Exercise 1 Function Design

#### Write the following functions. Pick descriptive names for the functions and their parameters.

* A function that returns True if a number is divisible by 7 and False if it does not.

* A function that returns True if a string is 10 characters or longer and False if it does not.

* A function that returns the first letter of a string

* A function that takes an integer and returns a list with that many elements, where every element is zero.

* A function that takes a list as input and prints out the contents of each element on a numbered line, like:

```
print_list(['a', 'bee', 'cee', None])
1. a
2. bee
3. cee
4. 'None'
```

* A function that takes a string as input and returns a list of two character segments of the string like:

```
segment('Carter Adams')
returns
['Ca', 'rt', 'et', ' A', 'da', 'ms']
```

* A function that when given an integer prints out that many dash charactes between two +'s, so dashprint(5) would print '+-----+' make sure the print ends in a new line.

* * This function should print, and not have any return value.

* A function that takes a string, and then uses that string as the prompt text for an input. Repeat the prompt as long as the input is not an integer. Return the integer (as an integer) when it is one.

* A function that takes two integers, one that represents a width and one that represents a height, and returns a new two dimensional array, where each element is None
