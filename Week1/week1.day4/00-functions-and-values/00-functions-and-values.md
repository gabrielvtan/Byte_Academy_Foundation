## Day 4 Exercise 1 functions and values

* There is nothing to turn in for this exercise

* What is the result of this program?:

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2

print(double(5))
```

* What are the outputs of this program:

def double2(x):

```python

def different_double(x):
    x = x * 2
    return x

a = 5
print(different_double(a))
print(a)

x = 5
print(different_double(x))
print(x)

different_double(x)
print(x)
```

* Do you understand the results of this? Do you understand the difference between 'print' and 'return?'

* Do you think it's better for most functions to use return or to use print?

```python
def pdouble(x):
    x = x * 2
    print(x)

def rdouble(x):
    x = x * 2
    return x

w = 5
x = pdouble(w)
print(x)

w = 8
y = pdouble(pdouble(w))
print(y)

w = 3
x = rdouble(w)
print(x)

w = 7
y = rdouble(rdouble(w))
print(y)
```

* What is the result of this?

```python
def dmult(x, y=2):
    x = x * y
    return x

print(dmult(5))
print(dmult(5, 3))
```
