navigating in the command line

pwd
shows you where you are

ls
shows what is in the folder you are in

cd 
moves you into a sub folder

cd ..
moves you back up a sub folder

cd ~
your unix home folder

if you get lost, run your python script, you'll see after the python -u the path to your project

right now I see 
python -u "/home/redcartel/cdrive/byte/curriculum/Foundation/4week/week1/day4/lecture/file_structure.py"

take out the .py file at the end and that's the folder.

you can cd into a full path like that. full paths start with a forward slash

cd /home/redcartel/cdrive/byte/curriculum/Foundation/4week/week1/day4/lecture
gets me to where my file is
