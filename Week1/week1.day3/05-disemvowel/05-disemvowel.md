## Day 2 Exercise 6b - Disemvowel

* There was an old forum online where the moderators had a policy of 'disemvoweling' trolling posts. This means modifying the text of the post to not include any vowels.

* Input a string and then print it out again with only the  non-vowel strings.

* This will involve a for loop and an if statement using in.
