## Day 3 - Exercise 1 Simple Lists

* Input a string, using a while loop to make the user enter new strings until the length is at least 5.

* Print the 5th character, otherwise print "It's short, but the last character is <>" where <> is the last character in the string.

* Use slice indexing ([a:b:c] possibly with some of the values missing) to store a string that is just
every second character.

* Convert the string to a list, store it in a new variable called list1

* Do the exact same thing and store it in list2

* Print the boolean result of list1 == list2

* Print the boolean result of list1 is list2

* Print a string that in your own words explains what is going on.

* Add '!' to the end of the list.

* put this line: ``` list3 = list1 ```

* store the new list [1, 2, 3] in the first element of list1 (overwrite the existing element)

* print the boolean value of ``` list1 == list3 ```

* print the boolean value of ``` list1 is list3 ```

* print list1

* print list3

* print a string that in your own words explains what is going on

* print the index of the '!'

* using for in, build a copy of list1 one element at a time.

* using an index value, a range, and a for statement, print each element of the list on its own line
