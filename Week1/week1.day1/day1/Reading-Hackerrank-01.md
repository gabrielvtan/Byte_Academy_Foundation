# Hackerrank and Reading

## hackerrank.com

* On weekdays other than Monday, we ask students to work on hackerrank from 10-11. Hackerrank is a website that has exercises in many programming languages. It tests both basic language familiarity and also more challenging problems to solve - the kinds of things that get asked in interviews for programming jobs.

* For your first hackerrank morning, join the site and sign up for **30 Days of Code** and the **Python** specific section.

* Try to do the following:

[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators/problem]

[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division]

[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-hello-world]

[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators]

* Some of the problems have links to suggested reading and resources. There are also discussion pages where other coders talk about how to solve the problem.

* Don't worry if you can't get through all of the exercises and all of the online problems and the book work in one day. We want day one to be a challenge so we can see where you are. Different students start with different levels of experience.

## Thinking Python

The excellent book, Think Python is available for free online. It organizes its material differently than we do our curriculum but seeing ideas more than one time is a good way to really learn them.

* Try to read the first chapter. 'The Way of the Program.'

* Look at the exercises at the end. The first chapter's exercises are really useful hints. Spend some time with number 4 if you can.
