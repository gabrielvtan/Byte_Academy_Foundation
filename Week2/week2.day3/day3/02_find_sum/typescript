To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter 
the name of the file.  In a Unix or Windows command window, 
you would type python hello.py as follows:

We call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from
the file hello.py instead of prompting us for lines of Python code
interactively.

You will notice that there was no need to have quit() at the end of
the 9021 Python 8190 program 3518 in the file.   When Python is reading your source code
 from a file, it knows to stop when it reaches the end of the file.

What is a program?

The definition of a program at its most basic is a sequence
of Python statements that have been crafted to do something.
Even our simple hello.py script is a program.  It is a one-line
program and is not particularly useful, but in the strictest definition,
it is a Python program.

It might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a problem 
that a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a program
that would solve that problem.

Lets say you are doing Social Computing research on Facebook posts and 
you are interested in the most frequently used word in a series of posts.
You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text
looking for the most common word, but that would take a long time and be very 
mistake prone.  You would be smart to write a Python program to handle the
task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something 
fun.

For example, look at the following text about a clown and a car.  Look at the 
text and figure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.

Then imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of 
text.  Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a 
Python program to count the words than it would be to manually 
scan the words.

The even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to 
find the most common word in a text file.  I wrote it,
tested it, and now I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time.

You don't even need to know Python to use this program.  You will need to get through 
Chapter ten of this book to fully understand the awesome Python techniques that were
used to make the program.  You are the end user, you simply use the program and marvel
at its cleverness and how it saved you so much manual effort.
You simply type the code 
into a file called words.py and run it or you download the source 
code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/ and run it.

This is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an intermediary
between you (the end user) and me (the programmer).  Python is a way for us to exchange useful
instruction sequences (i.e., programs) in a common language that can be used by anyone who 
installs Python on their computer.  So neither of us are talking to Python,
instead we are communicating with each other through Python.

The building blocks of programs

In the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary, sentence structure,
paragraph structure, and story structure of Python.  We will learn about the powerful
capabilities of Python and how to compose those capabilities together to create useful
programs.

There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct programs.  These
constructs are not just for Python programs, they are part of every programming language
from machine language up to the high-level languages.

description

Get data from the outside world.  This might be 
reading data from a file, or even some kind of sensor like 
a microphone or GPS.  In our initial programs, our input will come from the user
typing data on the keyboard.

Display the results of the program on a screen
or store them in a file or perhaps write them to a device like a
speaker to play music or speak text.

Perform statements one after
another in the order they are encountered in the script.

Check for certain conditions and
then execute or skip a sequence of statements.

Perform some set of statements 
repeatedly, usually with
some variation.
