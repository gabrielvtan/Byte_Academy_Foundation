## Foundation - Week 2 Day 1 reading

* Here is a good guide to the Linux / Unix command line, it covers some things we didn't go over:

* * You can stop reading at shell scripts, but if you're interested, scripts are a way of automating multiple shell commands into a single command. They're extremely useful! You can use them to invent your own commands. Eventually every developer should become familiar with shell scripting, but you don't have to do it today.

* The official book by the git team is very good. Read Chapter 2 today (git basics). Chapters 3 (branches) and 6 (github) are worth your time too. If you don't follow every word, don't worry about it.

* Read this blog post. It could very well save your life:

* Read section 12.2 of Think Python, "Tuples as Return Values." It's a little thing we didn't go over in week 1 that can be useful, how to return more than one value from a function.

#### Reading ahead:

* Chapter 2 of Grokking Algorithms on basic searching

* Chapters 15, 16, 17, and 18 of Think Python provide an overview of classes & objects, which is the final major language feature & concept we have left to learn.
